Getting started with OpenGL
=============

My first attempt at creating an OpenGL starter project, the only dependency should be CMake.

To compile you should be able to write: 

    git clone https://github.com/seshbot/new-gl-app
    cd new-gl-app
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..

    ./glapp
